The Main Idea : 
        Insertion Sort IS the opposite of the Bubble Sort in That
        If we Break the Sort operation at any time We will Find that The LEFT side will be sorted ,
        But Right Side is Not !  [ Whether Ascending or Descending ]

        {
            In Bubble Sorting the Sorted Part is The Right Part , and Hence We Make the Enhancement 
            For the Bubble Sort "Check Bubble-Enhance-1.cpp File"

            Of Course You Can Change the Direction of Bubble Sort (Right to Left or Left to Right )
            But this is not What we discuss Here  . 
            **Bubble Sort  By Default Bubbles items to Right 
        }

        Hence The outer Loop Works as the Following , at first we assume First Element is Sorted 
        In Each Iteration In the Outer Loop We Focus on One Element from the Right Side (The Unsorted Part)
        So We Start with "i"  =  the Index of 1 , And Increase it  To get an Element from the Right Side
        , And In the inner loop we Make j Equal to "i"
        In other Words , Every time We take an Element From the NON-sorted Side "RIGHT"
        and In the Inner Loop We INSERT it in its proper place In the Left Side

================
Complexity : 
    Time --> O(n**n)  >>> Two Loops 
    Space --> O(1) >>> Only Once Place For the swapping
