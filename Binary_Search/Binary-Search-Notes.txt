1-First of All , This Search Works only when Data is "SORTED" , Otherwise it will not work  ; 

2-Three Key Facotrs in BS : 
    - StartIndex  , EndIndex  , MiddleIndex (We Deal with index, if no result the index returned is -1 )


It is Clear and Simple in its implementation 

[ StartIndex <= EndIndex ]
 Because if They Crossed Then there is No Result  ; 

In BS with Recursion  , We Take the opposite Condition as the Base Case like Below : 
(startIndex > endIndex)
But Keep in mind In Recursion we Need {StartIndex , EndIndex , ArrayToBeSentForSeach }

****NOTE:
In the C++ Code for BS Recursion you will find a Fourth argument Which is " LengthOfArray" 
there is NO NEED for it ,But i kept it ;
