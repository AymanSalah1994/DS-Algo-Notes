The Main Idea : 
    Selection Sort is Really Clear , You First Consider If you Want to Sort [Asc Or Desc ]

    And You Will Have to Make as Always Two Loops : 

        - In the Outer , Every Time you Pick(SELECT) an Index , and Increase this Index in Each Iteration
        ( Nothing new about this ) , The SELECTED index Is Either the NextMinimumIndex OR NextMaximumIndex
        Depending on what sort you want [ Ascending or Descending ]

        - In the Inner loop : 
            You will Loop through all Elements AFTER the SELECTED index and Compare them with the SELECTED item , If their values  Smaller/Bigger Then You will Swap , But you will Continue the loop "till the End of the Array" so that the last Swap is the Valid Swap .

================
Complexity : 
Time >> O(n*n) {Two Nested loops }
Space >> O(1)   { Only swapping space }
