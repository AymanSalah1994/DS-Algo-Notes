Recursion Rules : 
    - Recursion is a Function [ And inside this Function you will find it Call itself ]
        $ - So i think no problem to call it a " Recursion Function "

    - Recursion can be replaced By Loops [ or thought of as a Loop ]
        [
            This is not a Rule , But you know if you can connect them both , nearly many loops Can be applid using Recursion and Vice versa  . 
            But of Course , Each has its pros , cons and Usages  ; 
        ]

    -Recursion Function Should Have at least two pillars : [ Using If & else ]
        1- Base Case  :
            Where the Function Ends and It does NOT call itself , it  returns something atomic 
            [Base Case is Like the Break Point in Loop ]

        2- Other cases : 
            Where the Function Calls itself again 

In Recursion the last Call of Function in the stack is the First to be Executed (From the Stack ) ; 
    - To Understand , Check the "Print-Array-Recursion.cpp" File . and Take a look at the notes in Comments 

Stack Overflow is a Common Problem that Happens Because of it  ;
