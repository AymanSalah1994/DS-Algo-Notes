Quick Sort in a Nutshell : 
    - You choose an Element  as a pivot [ Start Or End Element "Does NOT matter" ] this element is the pivot .

    - Now Pick an "Index Out Of Range"  , this out of range index is opposite to the pivot Element 
        - If you Pick Start Element as Pivot then the (Out of Range index is endIndex+1 )
        - If you Pick End Element as Pivot then the (Out of Range index is startIndex-1 )

    - Now Loop on the Array elements and Compare each element to pivot 
        - Based on this Comparing you will swap Elements [ Populate them starting from after the "Out of range index"]

    - After the loop Finish , put the pivot in the index that comes after the last index that had Swap .
        - if 3 items were swapped in indexes 1,2,3 THEN you put pivot in Index 4 so that Pivot is in the middle between 
        Big items and small items 

    
    - Return Back the New index for pivot , So that we Can divide the array into smaller parts (partial arrays) and Each partial array will also have a pivot where bigs (Big numbers) are in a side and smalls are in another side  .


=============
Complexity : 
    - For Quick Sort it is O(n*n) 
        But Some Refrences Consider the "Log" Complexity Although we Always Calculate the Worst case  ;
